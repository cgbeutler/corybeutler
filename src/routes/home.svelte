  This will one day be a fancy welcome page. For now it is a placeholder.
  I am surprised that you are even reading this! Here is a haiku for you:<br>
</p>
<div class="poem">
  I wish I could bake<br>
  I would bake you a nice cake<br>
  here, have a raw egg
</div>
<p>
  I hope you enjoyed that poem. Good luck in your many journeys.
